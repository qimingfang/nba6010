				<h3>Question 1</h3>
				<p>Every year, career services across the US put in a lot of effort collecting and compiling responses from students regarding their post-graduation plans. The response rate is low (~60-70%); some departments may not have the budget to issue complex surveys that require a lot of processing time, and all of the responses are confined to the scope of a single university. Even within Cornell, each of the colleges have their own separate career office, and there is no central source of information. Some students are curious to know where their friends from other universities are going. Other students want to find out who their future colleagues may be. Parents would like to know which law schools attract the most number of Ivy League students. Recruiters are interested in the distribution of companies that students in different schools apply to. Currently, these questions remain unanswerable since the statistics do not span across multiple universities.
				</p>
				<p>
				Alumanac is a web platform that looks to answer these questions. We ask students to enter some information such as university, major, company/grad school, and location into our system. In exchange, we provide them with not only answers to the questions above but also a sense of pride in letting the world know where they chose to be after graduation. With connections to LinkedIn and Facebook, Alumanac can easily expand into a networking platform for students to connect with those around them. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Alumanac will make money by selling subscriptions to parents, recruiters, and career services. Since we are simplifying the work that many career services and recruiting agencies have to do, we believe that they will be happy to purchase an annual subscription of Alumanac at a reasonable price. As there are around 4,500 degree granting institutions  (National Center for Educational Statistic) and tens of thousands of large companies in the US (US Census), we believe that this is a large enough market size for our business to grow. Furthermore, we have a unique advantage in that we have several Cornell resources from which to draw upon to add value to this service immediately. One of the most important aspects will be quantity of data available through Alumanac; through readily available career statistics and through our own personal Cornell networks, we will be able to have a number of immediate entries to the Alumanac which will make joining it more enticing to our first new members.
				</p>
				<p>
				Our major competitors will consist of social networking  professional networking companies:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://branchout.com/">BranchOut</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.viadeo.com">Viadeo</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.xing.com">Xing</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Question 2</h3>					
				<p>
					<a href="img/linkedin.png" rel="lightbox[a1]" title="The LinkedIn Logo" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:right; margin:20px;">
						<img src="img/linkedin.png" alt="The LinkedIn Logo" />
					</a>
					
					<a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> is one of our competitors that specialize in connecting people together through professional networks. On LinkedIn, users can search for others by filling in specialized search criteria, such as company, location, school, title, and many more. LinkedIn also allows the user to filter search results by industry, group, relationship, function, and company size. LinkedIn also has a huge (200 million) user base as well as a large team of developers working on the optimization of the search algorithms and monitoring the performance of their web services. On Feb. 7, 2013, LinkedIn reported a fourth quarter financial performance of $303.6 million, leading to an earnings per share of $0.35.
				</p>
				
				<p>Our competitive advantage over LinkedIn lies in the fact that we are able to leverage other social networking platforms to better target college graduates. For example, Alumanac will be integrated with web services such as Facebook and Google to allow users to search across multiple domains. In addition, Alumanac is built on top of a map interface, whereas LinkedIn is built on top of a resume-looking interface. This gives us a competitive advantage because users are psychologically more comfortable with location-based networking when they are presented with a map, rather than a text box. Finally, Alumanac looks to provide recent college graduates a way of social networking whereas LinkedIn looks to provide a business networking service to professional individuals. Because of this, the Alumanac web interface can have a more comfortable look-and-feel, which recent graduates may find less intimidating than LinkedIn's web interface.

				<h3>Question 6</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Challenge from below (lower quality, but cheap) tactics are examples of disruptive technologies. Online education is much lower in quality compared to classroom education; there is no direct access with the professor (lectures are asynchronous), and everything is semi-automated. Students feel as if they're learning from a computer rather than a human. However, services like Udacity is free, which gives it a huge advantage in the education industry.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Technologies often offer lower quality initially in order to serve a greater number of users and avoid competitive reaction. As time passes, disruptive technologies often gain quality and become the mainstream.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								We don't anticipate that there will be disruptive technologies in our business. Since we are offering our product for free, it's hard for competitors to offer a lower quality and cheaper product (unless they're willing to pay people to use it!).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

			<div class="well well-small span11 centered">
				<h3>Question 7</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><p>An example of a product with positive network effects is Facebook. The value that any individual customer derives from facebook increases as more people use facebook.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>Alumanac also has positive network effects. The more students that use Alumanac, the more valuable the search results (where are my friends going to be; who will be attending the same graduate schools as me; etc) will be for any particular student.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>Fashion and reputation can definitely lead to positive network effects. The more people that wear a specific brand of clothing, for example, the more others will want it (in order to fit in with fashion). Having a positive reputation and being the product that all consumers want can affect the value of almost all products, including ours.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							The internet is still young enough that people don't know what kind of regulations need to exist for giant internet monopolies. People can't live without search (Google), social networking (Facebook), microposts (Twitter), and other web services. These companies are now large enough that it's extremely hard for competitors to enter the market. Google, as the article points out, collects 83&#37; of the market while it's competitor Microsoft's bing could only capture around 3&#37; when it tried to challenge Google in search. This is an economic problem just as how other monopolies (AT&amp;T for example) in history have been economic problems.

				<h3>Question 8</h3>
				<p>
					A TraceRoute showed that data from a computer in carpenter computer labs takes 4 hops to get to the firewall at MIT. The slowest node is located at 128.253.222.145. It's average RTT is around 3ms with a max of 20ms.

					 For this exercise, we used LogMeIn. In our scenario, computer A is the technician and computer B is the client. Computer A is trying to remotely connect to computer B. Computer A (the technician) had to first download and install a program (Technician Console). Then, a popup appears that allows A to generate 6 digit pin number. The client (B) is told to go to <a href="http://www.logmein123.com">http://www.logmein123.com</a>. There, he is prompted to enter the 6 digit pin number. Upon completion, an executable is downloaded onto computer B. If user B runs that executable, he is now connected to the technician.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the technician chooses to launch a remote control session, user B gets a big warning telling him that someone is trying to access his computer. If user B clicks "OK" then his computer's desktop shows up on user A's Technician Console. User A use this console to drag user B's windows around, transfer files, execute scripts and view system info (BIOS, CPU usage, Physical Memory, etc).

				<h3>Question 10</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><p>
							<ol>
								<li>Technology may be hard to use (high learning curve), so productiviy is not immediate</li>
								<li>IT is misused</li>
								<li>It takes time to adapt a technology to a business</li>
								<li>It takes time to adapt a business to a technology</li>

						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<ol>
								<li>Factories, for example, spend lots of time and money to get their workers up to speed with the various machines they will be expected to operate during production.</li>
								<li>Firm level data shows that there are 2 groups of people: those who use the technology correctly and those who don't. In fact, the CIO of HP commented on the astonishing number of IT projects that fail.
								<li>If current online retail companies want to interface with a technology like Facebook for example, they will need to rearchitect their backend systems to accept facebook users. This takes time to accomplish.</li>
								<li>Many small startups nowadays found that they need to enhance their social presence, since so many of their customers are engaged in social networks. Therefore, they need to change their business to fit with technologies such as Facebook.</li>
							</ol>
						</p></li>
						<li>
							<p>Network effects suggest that products with positive network effects will not experience much growth in the first few years of operation. As more users start using it, these products become more and more valuable and gain adoption much more quickly. Networks effects may be another reason why it seems to Solow as if IT does not lead to more productivity. If a firm is using a technology with positive network effects and there aren't that many others using it, then this product will not be very useful to the company in generating productivity. As time passes, however, it will be a lot more useful, resulting in sudden productivity increases.

				<h3>Question 11</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><p>A virtual corporation is a business where employees are rapidly formed into teams of collaboration, and then rapidly disbanded and formed into other teams of collaboration. Construction and consulting are two examples of virtual corporations.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>Virtual corporations are good because they are especially efficient and can quickly react to opportunities very quickly. In addition, virtual corporations hire contractors as needed, so budget is not <i>wasted</i> on experts that may not be needed. A disadvantage of virtual corporations is that experts may not be available when opportunities arise. Another disadvantage is that company secrets may be lost to other companies, and that the company has no control over some operations.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
						InterSolve assembles "just in time" teams of experts to solve problems for their clients. One benefit of doing business this way, they say, is that they bring in the right talent for the right task. A team of 26 people, for example, was able to save $14 million for First Interstate's operations. This is a perfect example of a virtual corporation. InterSolve does not have permanent employees. It is simply a hub that recruits specialized talent for short periods of time. After the project gets done, InterSolve disbands the team and recreates another team based on what its next assignment is.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
						Alumanac cannot be convereted to a virtual corporation. Universities, on the other hand, can be convereted to a virtual corporation. Professors come from all sorts of backgrounds. They can be the experts that get assembled for a short period of time (to teach a class for example). After the class is over, the university can disband the professors, and re-hire other experts based on classes it plans to offer in the next semester. The problem with this is that professors are frequently also involved in research. Although they can move to a different location to teach a class, their graduate students and collaborators will not be able to easily relocate. As a result, their research progress may be slowed.

				<h3>Question 12</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
						<p>We used WebEx for this part. We found, after logging in, that we can run WebEx through the browser using a java plugin. This plugin crashes very often (it crashed during startup multiple times). WebEx does allow the presenter to send out invitations for people to join his meeting. The attendees don't need to install a separate WebEx client, and can launch WebEx straight through the browser. When WebEx finally started up, it first prompted the presenter with a dialog box of how to set up an audio connection (for those who may be calling in for example). WebEx also gives the presenter (not the others) an option to share his desktop. WebEx also provides a dropdown menu for the presenter to share files with his clients. When the host clicks share desktop, a green bar shows up at the top of his screen to notify him that he is currently sharing his desktop. Hovering over the bar exposes more options, such as share File and share Application. WebEx also exposes a chat window that can be brought up so that the presenter can chat while sharing his screen. This chat is hidden from his clients, in case he is conversing about secret information. WebEx also allows the presenter to record and annotate the meeting, for later (asynchronous) sessions.
						</p>
						<p>Because the computers in carpenter computer lab do not have webcams, we did not observe an easy way to share video through WebEx. We were successful in an audio chat (with the help of microphones). Below is a set of screenshots capturing what we observed.

							<p>
							Google Docs is a great resouce for synchronous document sharing. It is extremely easy to use, keeps a change log of previous versions (in case the user would like to revert to a previous version), does a good job handling synchronous writes, is easily sharable, and can embed various types multimedia elements. A problem we encountered was that if one user is typing on top of another, every time the first user generates a new line, the second user's screen will shift down a little. This may be unpleasant from the second user's point of view. In addition, since Google Docs is built into a web interface, support for more complex fonts, and functionalities are a bit lacking compared to asynchronous solutions such as MS Word. For example, MS word supports the watermark feature (to insert a watermark onto every page of the document) while Google Docs does not.
