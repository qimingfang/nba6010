				<h3>Question 1</h3>
				<p>Every year, career services across the US put in a lot of effort collecting and compiling responses from students regarding their post-graduation plans. The response rate is low (~60-70%); some departments may not have the budget to issue complex surveys that require a lot of processing time, and all of the responses are confined to the scope of a single university. Even within Cornell, each of the colleges have their own separate career office, and there is no central source of information. Some students are curious to know where their friends from other universities are going. Other students want to find out who their future colleagues may be. Parents would like to know which law schools attract the most number of Ivy League students. Recruiters are interested in the distribution of companies that students in different schools apply to. Currently, these questions remain unanswerable since the statistics do not span across multiple universities.
				</p>
				<p>
				Alumanac is a web platform that looks to answer these questions. We ask students to enter some information such as university, major, company/grad school, and location into our system. In exchange, we provide them with not only answers to the questions above but also a sense of pride in letting the world know where they chose to be after graduation. With connections to LinkedIn and Facebook, Alumanac can easily expand into a networking platform for students to connect with those around them. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Alumanac will make money by selling subscriptions to parents, recruiters, and career services. Since we are simplifying the work that many career services and recruiting agencies have to do, we believe that they will be happy to purchase an annual subscription of Alumanac at a reasonable price. As there are around 4,500 degree granting institutions  (National Center for Educational Statistic) and tens of thousands of large companies in the US (US Census), we believe that this is a large enough market size for our business to grow. Furthermore, we have a unique advantage in that we have several Cornell resources from which to draw upon to add value to this service immediately. One of the most important aspects will be quantity of data available through Alumanac; through readily available career statistics and through our own personal Cornell networks, we will be able to have a number of immediate entries to the Alumanac which will make joining it more enticing to our first new members.

					</a>
					<a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> is one of our competitors that specialize in connecting people together through professional networks. On LinkedIn, users can search for others by filling in specialized search criteria, such as company, location, school, title, and many more. LinkedIn also allows the user to filter search results by industry, group, relationship, function, and company size. LinkedIn also has a huge (200 million) user base as well as a large team of developers working on the optimization of the search algorithms and monitoring the performance of their web services. On Feb. 7, 2013, LinkedIn reported a fourth quarter financial performance of $303.6 million, leading to an earnings per share of $0.35.
				</p>
				
				<p>Our competitive advantage over LinkedIn lies in the fact that we are able to leverage other social networking platforms to better target college graduates. For example, Alumanac will be integrated with web services such as Facebook and Google to allow users to search across multiple domains. In addition, Alumanac is built on top of a map interface, whereas LinkedIn is built on top of a resume-looking interface. This gives us a competitive advantage because users are psychologically more comfortable with location-based networking when they are presented with a map, rather than a text box. Finally, Alumanac looks to provide recent college graduates a way of social networking whereas LinkedIn looks to provide a business networking service to professional individuals. Because of this, the Alumanac web interface can have a more comfortable look-and-feel, which recent graduates may find less intimidating than LinkedIn's web interface.

				<h3>Question 7</h3>
				<p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>An example of a product with positive network effects is Facebook. The value that any individual customer derives from facebook increases as more people use facebook.
						</li>
						<li>Alumanac also has positive network effects. The more students that use Alumanac, the more valuable the search results (where are my friends going to be; who will be attending the same graduate schools as me; etc) will be for any particular student.
						</li>
						<li>Fashion and reputation can definitely lead to positive network effects. The more people that wear a specific brand of clothing, for example, the more others will want it (in order to fit in with fashion). Having a positive reputation and being the product that all consumers want can affect the value of almost all products, including ours.

					A TraceRoute showed that data from a computer in carpenter computer labs takes 4 hops to get to the firewall at MIT. The slowest node is located at 128.253.222.145. It's average RTT is around 3ms with a max of 20ms.
